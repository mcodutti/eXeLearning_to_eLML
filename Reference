                     eXe2eLML - Reference
-----------------------------------------------------------

This document contains informations I found when writing
the script.

Why use the "One page HTML export" of eXeLearning ?
------------------------------------------------------
1) The internal data format for an eXe document was not clear to me
   It is a zip of a ".data" file and I was not able to understand it.
2) The "One page HTML export" is a XHTML file which was very adapted
   to a XSLT transformation
3) Badfully it does not preserve the tree structure of the (exe) Idevices
   (they are all put at the same level)

Structure of the "One page HTML export" of eXeLearning
------------------------------------------------------
html
	head
	body
		div id=content
			div id=header // the document title
			div id=main
				div class=node	// each section
					div id=nodeDecoration
						p id=nodeTitle // section title
					div class=***Idevice   // each Idevice

The exact ***Idevice depends on the content's type
- custom : free text with some personalized stuff (like the icon)
- objectives : free text aiming to give the objectives of the document
- MultiSelect : multiple choice exercice
- activity : an activity (something the student should do)
- FreeText : free text
- Cloze : fill in the blanks exercice

The structure of an Idevice vary but with a common basis.
div class=***Idevice
	div class=iDevice 	// + emphasis1 (or 0? not clear to me)
		img				// Idevice's icon
		span	class=iDeviceTitle	// Idevice's title	
		div class=iDevice_inner         // Idevice's content

Issues
------
- Paragraphs
	A <p> tag is converted into a <paragraph> tag. But it seems that eLML
	merge to consecutives paragraphs so I added a <newLine/> at the end
	of each <paragraph> which is too much in some case
	Todo : Add a <newLine/> only if the following is also a <paragraph>
- Fill in the Blanks
	In the eXe output, answers are coded so I insert a default answer
	Toto : investigate the javascript that decode the answer and use
	it during the conversion.
