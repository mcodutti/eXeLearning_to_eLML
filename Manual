                     eXe2eLML - Manual
-----------------------------------------------------------
  
How to use it
-------------
  1 - Open the eXe document with the eXeLearning software
  2 - Export it as a "unique HTML page"
  3 - Apply this script on the result using a XSLT processor

It should work with any XSLT processor although I only tried it with "xsltproc"

What is done
------------
It creates the main structure of the eLML document but :

  - As the eXe export do not preserve the embedding of section, the script
    create one unit with all the learningObjects
  - The first node is converted into the unit's entry not a learningObject

The following IDevice are translated

  - Activity : done
	put into an <act> tag with the "act" icon
  - FreeText : done
	put into a <clarify> tag with no icon
  - Objectives : done (treated as an Activity device)
	put into an <clarify> tag with the "objective" icon
  - Multiple Choice : done
	put into an <act> tag, shuffle mode on
  - Cloze (fillInBlanks) : partially done
	As the answers are coded they are not in the resulting document
  - custom : done
	put into an <clarify> tag with the icon found in the first <img> tag

Feedbacks

  - <div> with the 'feedback' class are put into a <popup>

Images

  - If an image is found, it is translated into <multimedia> tag inside
    a <popup> tag. (remove the <popup> if not suitable for you)
  - It assumes that the images are to be found in the "../images" directory

Inside an IDevice the following are translated
  - ordered an unordered lists
  - styles : bold, italic and code
  - paragraphs
