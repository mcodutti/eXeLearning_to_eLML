                     eXe2eLML - Manual
-----------------------------------------------------------
  
How to use it
-------------
  1 - Open the eXe document with the eXeLearning software
  2 - Export it as a "unique HTML page"
  3 - Apply this script on the result using a XSLT processor

It should work with any XSLT processor although I only tried it with "xsltproc"
usage: xsltproc --html exe2eLML.xsl eXeExport.html >eLMLOutput.xml

What is done
------------
It creates the main structure of the eLML document but :

  - As the eXe export do not preserve the embedding of section, the script
    create one unit with all the learningObjects
  - The first node is converted into the unit's entry not a learningObject

IDevice translation status (7 out of 19 done)

 - Activity         : done (put into an <act> tag with the "act" icon)
 - Case Study       : no
 - Cloze Activity   : ~  (as the answers are coded they are not in the resulting document)
 - External website : no 
 - Free Text Area   : done (put into a <clarify> tag with no icon)
 - Image Gallery    : no
 - Image Magnbifier : no
 - Multi-Choice     : done (put into an <act> tag, shuffle mode on)
 - Multi-select     : no
 - Java Applet      : no
 - Objectives       : done (put into an <clarify> tag with the "objective" icon)
 - Preknowledge     : no
 - RSS              : no
 - Reading Activity : no
 - Reflection       : done
 - SCORM Quiz       : no
 - True/False       : no
 - Wiki article     : no
 - Custom           : done (put into an <clarify> tag with the icon found in the first <img> tag)

Feedbacks

  - <div> with the 'feedback' class are put into a <popup>

Images

  - If an image is found, it is translated into <multimedia> tag inside
    a <popup> tag. (remove the <popup> if not suitable for you)
  - It assumes that the images are to be found in the "../images" directory

Inside an IDevice the following are translated
  - ordered an unordered lists
  - styles : bold, italic and code
  - paragraphs
  
Some Issues
-----------
1) A multi-choice with only one correct answer will be treated as a single-choice by eLML
   (so visually clear for the reader that only one answer is correct)
