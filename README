                       eXe2eLML
-----------------------------------------------------------
  A script to convert a pedagogical document from the
  eXeLearning format to the eLML one.

  eXeLearning : http://exelearning.org/
  eLML        : http://www.elml.org/

  It has been written for my practical situation but may be
  useful for others too.

  How it works :
  1 - Open the eXe document with the eXeLearning software
  2 - Export it as a "unique HTML page"
  3 - Apply this script on the result using a XSLT processor

  It should work with any XSLT processor although 
  I only tried it with "xsltproc"
