-----------------------------------------------------------
  A script to convert a pedagogical document from the
  eXeLearning format to the eLML one.

  eXeLearning : http://exelearning.org/
  eLML        : http://www.elml.org/

  It has been written for my practical situation but may be
  useful for others too.
